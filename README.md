# Assignment 7
This assignment is not an actual assignment. In fact, Ben, one of the TAs (?) made it up for fun. Although I failed the class, I thought it was a perfect opportunity to work on it.
**NOTE:** Currently the Wide function works, per se, but is not working as efficiently as Ben's actual code.

## Building
Running `make` will build all

Running  `make grass` will only compile *grass*

### Running
`./grass [-aswrvh] [-f size] [-n seed]`
